# Tools and Agents in LangChain

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of LangChain to build tools and agents with the following capabilities:
- Interacting with OpenAI's API for LLM tasks.
- Loading web-based documents.
- Chunking and embedding document data.
- Creating retrievers for question-answering workflows.

The notebook integrates LangChain's components such as document loaders, vector stores (e.g., FAISS), and LLM-based agents to process and retrieve information effectively.

## Features

1. **Language Model Integration**:
   - Uses `ChatOpenAI` to interact with OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
   - Demonstrates basic invocation of the LLM.

2. **Document Loading and Indexing**:
   - Web-based document loading using `WebBaseLoader`.
   - Text chunking and splitting for document processing via `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Embedding of chunks for semantic search using `FAISS`.

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Indexed documents allow for semantic search using LangChain retrievers.
   - Example usage of the retriever to answer specific queries (e.g., "How to upload a dataset?").
